## Introduction! :bowtie:

Tell us what your code does!
Give us some higher level detail! (You will go into detail later)


### How To Use It! :computer:

Tell us how to start using your code and provide
a few examples!



Example `main.c`:
```
#include "holberton.h"

int main(void)
{
    _printf("Hello, World!");

    return (0);
}
```

Compilation:
```
$ gcc *.c -o test
```

Output:
```
$ ./test
Hello, World!
$
```

## Description :speech_balloon:
Give more details about your code such as:
* Output
* Input (does it only take certain data types?)
* Formatting
* A prototype if someone was to use your code

### Return Value(s)
* Tell us what you expect the code to return (assuming it does)!
* Tell us what to expect if theres errors (wrong input, special
cases that the code doesnt cover yet)

### Formatting
* Will need for printf!
* Tell us what kind of formatting the code expects
* Tell us what happens when not done right!
* Should we expect any flag characters?

### Flag Characters :crossed_flags:
* Tell us what the flags are and what they do!
* Give a few examples!
