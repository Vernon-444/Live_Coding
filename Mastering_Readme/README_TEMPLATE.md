## Introduction! :bowtie:

Tell us what your code does!
Give us some higher level detail! (You will go into detail later)


### How To Use It! :computer:

Tell us how to start using your code and provide
a few examples!



Example `main.c`:
```
#include "holberton.h"

int main(void)
{
    _printf("Hello, World!");

    return (0);
}
```

Compilation:
```
$ gcc *.c -o test
```

Output:
```
$ ./test
Hello, World!
$
```

## Description :speech_balloon:
Give more details about your code such as:
1. Output
1. Input (does it only take certain data types?)
1. Formatting
1. An example of using your code, and the output
    1. Use code blocks!

### Return Value(s)
* Tell us what you expect the code to return (assuming it does)!
* Tell us what to expect if theres errors (wrong input, special
cases that the code doesnt cover yet)

### Formatting
* Tell us what kind of formatting the code expects (if expected)
* Tell us what happens when not used properly!
    * Or if there are any bugs (if known)

| Known Error | Cause      |
|:-------------:|:--------:|
|Seg Fault    |Didn't account for more than 3 arguments|
|    Frowny Face    | You didn't say please when running the code (you're rude)|

* Keep it creative, but also professional
* Have fun with it!
